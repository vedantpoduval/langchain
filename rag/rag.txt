 RAG Pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG combines retrieval and generation to produce contextually relevant and factually grounded responses.

---

 Key Components
1. Query Input: User’s prompt or question.
2. Retriever: Fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).
3. Knowledge Base: External repository of structured or unstructured information.
4. Language Model: Generates responses based on retrieved context (e.g., GPT, Llama2).
5. Output: Factual and context-aware responses.

 Workflow
1. User query → Retriever fetches relevant documents.
2. Retrieved documents are appended to the query.
3. Language model generates a response using the enriched context.
